Usage
=====

Preparation before running
--------------------------

If you are using a character encodings other than UTF-8 for filename on
Unix-like OS, you must set the following environmental variable (it will not
work correctly if it is not specified):

(use locale-specific encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=@locale

or

(manually specifying encoding)
% export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1

If you want to display messages translated to your language,
you must specify some environmental variables related to locale.
For example:

% export LANG=de_DE

(replace de_DE to the actual locale name)

If you don't want translated messages, set LC_MESSAGES to "C"
(and unset LC_ALL if specified).

----------

gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config glib-2.0 --cflags --libs` -lsylph
